## Introduction
Have you ever felt like your team uses email for everything, and designs end up getting lost in your inbox? Fireframe solves this problem with its web based design collaboration platform.

Without any previous design software knowledge, non-designers can quickly create wireframe designs that designers can easily understand and further develop. This facilitates the creative process for both designers and non-designers alike; therefore, reducing the number of iterations needed to come up with a design.

## Main Features
### Fully-Featured Editing Suite
* Multiple elements to choose from:
  * Premade browser window
  * Text boxes
  * Basic shapes
  * Tables
  * Lists
  * Images
* Components can be customized. You can change:
  * Color
  * Size
  * Opacity
  * Borders
  * Position
  * Etc ...
* Easily manipulate your designs with built-in keyboard shortcuts

### Real-Time Collaboration
* Join a room and build designs together
* Changes made by one user are immediately visible on the other users' workspaces

### Remote access & editing
* Access and edit your designs anywhere you have an internet connection
* No need to download desktop software
* No need to find a meeting location

### Version Control
* See how projects evolve
* A new version is created each time a version is opened up for editing
* Any version can be arbitrarily assigned as the master
  * Users can create multiple new versions without committing to a particular one
* Versions are stored in a tree-like structure
